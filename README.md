### Previous article
+ Currently, most Google interfaces use `https://translate.google.com/translate_a/single`

But it always pops up verification (Google's reCAPTCHA),
Because of domestic reasons, the IP often changes, so verification pops up frequently. As a result, it cannot be used

+ Found that `https://translate.google.com/m` can be used
Python version [deep-translator](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator)

+ I looked and found that there is no golang version (because I want to run the binary on arm), so I wrote one
